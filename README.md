# HDC 2016
This repository is for the HDC 2016 Presentation "Secure your ASP.NET MVC and WebApi Applications."  It includes the source code of the demo site as well the presentation itself.

# Requirements
The demo site was created using Visual Studio 2015 Community Edition.  It should work in any version of Visual Studio 2015 or greater.  It uses IIS Express so you don't have to configure an IIS server.
