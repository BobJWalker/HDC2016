<h1>Cookie Policies</h1>
<p>Cookie Policies help keep your cookies from being hijacked by an XSS attack.  This is a layer of defense that will help in the event your site is compromised.  It will also prevent anyone who is sniffing the network traffic from getting a cookie.</p>

<p>By default all cookies in ASP.NET are HttpOnly.  The configuration has been altered to allow you to view the cookies</p>
